Sadly, the hot weather and heavy traffic here has increased the risk of getting stroke or getting involved in accidents for those tourists. Congested traffic have always impede medical aid from reaching those who are in need whenever an accident happened. 因此，马六甲中央区姑务圣约翰自行车急救联队发起了自行车急救队，每逢星期日将会位于鸡场街、古城门、及红屋一带巡逻，以便能在意外发生时。姑务自行车急救队的发起是为了让救护人员能够第一时间赶到事发现场，在救伤车到达前给予及时救援。（自行车能够轻易的穿梭如鸡场街的小巷及交通拥挤的马六甲市中心。）Thus, the Kubu Division of St. John Ambulance Malaysia (SJAM), Malacca had launched their very own Cycle Response Unit (CRU). Since then, they patrolled around the city center, which includes Jonker Walk, A Famosa, and The Stadthuys; aiming to provide first aid to anyone in need as soon as possible. (They chose to cycle because cycling can bring the first aiders to most parts of the area faster without the risk of getting stuck in a traffic) 目前，姑务圣约翰自行车急救联队也参与了许多大型活动，他们并不只限制于旅游区。2016年，他们受到槟城圣约翰救伤机构的邀请，到槟城大桥国际马拉松的现场待命，一旦发生突发状况他们将第一时间给予援助。2016年至今，他们也参与了不同规模较大的活动，例如义跑及露营等。Until now, Kubu’s CRU had participated in several major events, including charity runs and camps. In 2016, they were invited by St. John Ambulance Penang to join them in the annual Penang Bridge International Marathon as medical response unit to provide first aid service to the participants. 马六甲圣约翰救伤队中央区区指挥官陈爱婷同志披露，参与了自行车急救队后，队员们都感觉充满正能量。他们目前不只学习急救，也有一个让他们学以致用的机会。为了提升服务性质，队员们也会参与特定的课程以便能够了解一些高科技仪器的使用方式，让队员们提供更有效率的服务。The area commander of SJAM Malacca, Melaka Tengah area, Kristil Tan Ai Teng said, ever since participating in CRU, members are filled with positive energy. CRU have provided a platform for the members to apply what they had learnt during first aid courses. In addition, they are exposed to various first aid equipment and learnt how to use them, thereby, improve their service efficiency. 陈爱婷表示，她不希望队员只是单方面对圣约翰救伤队做出贡献，她希望透过自行车救伤队让队员从中获益，学习到更多的技能。这样一来，队员们以后在各个领域都能站稳脚步。Kristil also said, she do not wish to see the members making unilateral contribution to SJAM, she hopes that the members of SJAM can equip themselves with more life skills through participating in CRU. Hence, the members can stand firm in various fields. 给予这些人民的救伤英雄一个尊敬吧！Kudos to these first aid heroes! #ABrandNewU每个人都有实现梦想的机会，你也有类似的经验？私聊A_Brand_New_U面子书，并且关注：Facebook- A_Brand_New_UInstagram- abrandnewu_youthknighted","categories":[{"name":"正能量故事","slug":"正能量故事","permalink":"http://abrandnewu.com.my/categories/正能量故事/"}],"tags":[{"name":"正能量故事","slug":"正能量故事","permalink":"http://abrandnewu.com.my/tags/正能量故事/"}]},{"title":"TN50 国家转型计划对话会 National Transformation Plan Dialogue","slug":"012 - TN50-国家转型计划对话会","date":"2017-04-18T14:50:49.000Z","updated":"2017-04-25T04:23:38.660Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/04/18/012 - TN50-国家转型计划对话会/","link":"","permalink":"http://abrandnewu.com.my/2017/04/18/012 - TN50-国家转型计划对话会/","excerpt":"","text":"“与年轻人谈未来，就是与未来同在”“Discussing the future with youngsters implies being with the future” 过去的马来西亚陷入失落的 10 年，人民及国家都被消极与负能量重重包围，影响国家的整体的前进步伐。而TN50的出现，就是与大家携手让马来西亚再次美好。因此，青年骑士（YouthKnighted）荣幸获得拿督斯礼廖中莱的支持，并努力召集更多的年轻人及全国相关的人士一起了解TN50的意义。In the past 10 years Malaysians have been shrouded by negative thoughts and pessimistic attitude. This phenomenon is one of the hurdles that affects the pace of our country’s advancement. Therefore, TN50 (National Transformation Plan, “Transformasi Negara 2050”) was launched with the intention of bringing the people together to restore Malaysia to its former glory.

There are approximately 1500 youngsters who attended the dialogue. 若要让国家能够持续发展，全国人民必须跳出封闭思想，多了解及勇于尝试与其他种族打成一片，多接触不同的文化风情，并且邀请他人一起为国家未来的美好做出改变。只有和谐共处，并携手努力为国家未来做出贡献，哪怕只是个小小的建议，也可能影响马来西亚美好的未来。TN50属于马来西亚的新希望，并与大家携手一起#ABrandNewU，共同塑造个人及国家美好的未来。All Malaysians have to obliterate closed-minded thinking, get along with other races, and get in touch with different cultures in order to allow our country to advance and develop. Only through unity of all the races and have them working together as one nation, will the country have a brighter future. Even a small suggestion can change the fate of Malaysia.

After dropping out of school she decided to improve her family’s financial status by getting a job. Her salary was only RM500. There was even times where they can’t even afford a proper meal and had to fill their stomach with just guavas. Kinki was attracted by the art of tattooing when she went to a barber shop and noticed the owner of the shop has a tattoo on his body. She wanted a tattoo so badly she even ignored the law which states that anyone under the age of 18 must have the consent of their parents or guardians to have a tattoo. She then found a tattoo artist for her tattoo. After Kinki did her first tattoo, she immediately regretted as the artist was lacking in skills and she ended up with a scarred tattoo. Thus she decided to find another professional tattoo artist redo her tattoo.在Kinki刚踏入中学那一年，因为父亲患上肾病，加上家里经济状况不稳定，Kinki被迫辍学。辍学后的她在外打工帮补家计，每个月只赚取五百令吉。在没钱时，他只能靠吃番石榴来充饥。当时，在理发店打工的她被老板身上的刺青吸引，也想要在自己身上纹身。虽然当时法律规定未满18岁者必须得到家长或监护人的同意后才能纹身，但她没有理会，找了一位师傅直接替她纹身。Kinki提到，第一次纹身时她只觉得很痛也感到后悔，后悔是因为师傅的手工很差，她的纹身很快就出现“浮雕”的情况，所以她决定找另一位师傅重新帮她纹身。 At the age of 16, Kinki found a professional tattoo artist by the name of Water that was willing to redo her tattoo. Water also happened to be her mentor after that. Kinki mentioned that she was determined to be a tattoo artist because she was attracted to her mentor’s tattooing skills and tattoo technology. In two years , Kinki kept practicing her tattooing skills on pig skin daily and her first work was a tattoo on her right ankle. Since she wasn’t allowed to be a tattoo artist by her age at that time due to her young age, Kinki became an apprentice until the age of 18, when she was officially allowed to tattoo customers.到了16岁，Kinki终于找到师傅替她重新纹身。那位师傅也是她的恩师Water，她说是因为被恩师的纹身技术吸引，才下定决心拜师学艺。她用了两年的时间，总算有了一点成绩。在这两年里，她每天反反复复在一个又一个的猪皮上练习纹身的技巧，她的第一件作品就是在自己右脚踝上的刺青。基于未成年者不所以Kinki当了两年的徒，直到18岁才正式为客人纹身。 Kinki claims that she is very satisfied with her current career, but she hopes to work with her mentor to open a tattoo college and hold tattoo art exhibition. Kinki wishes that she can help people who are interested in tattooing to have a place to show their potential, but the lass also hopes that through the academy and the art shows, people will have more exposure to the art of tattooing.Kinki声称她对现在的事业非常满意，但她希望能够与恩师一起开设一家纹身学院及纹身艺术展。她想让更多想学纹身的人能有一个展现自己潜能的空间，也希望通过学院及艺术展让更多人认识纹身。 别把梦想留给遗憾，如果你正在追梦，不要因为一路的荆棘而放弃，勇敢的去追逐你的梦想吧！ #ABrandNewU每个人都有实现梦想的机会，你也有类似的经验？私聊A_Brand_New_U面子书，并且关注：Facebook- A_Brand_New_UInstagram- abrandnewu_youthknighted","categories":[{"name":"正能量故事","slug":"正能量故事","permalink":"http://abrandnewu.com.my/categories/正能量故事/"}],"tags":[{"name":"正能量故事","slug":"正能量故事","permalink":"http://abrandnewu.com.my/tags/正能量故事/"}]},{"title":"小英雄大贡献 ( Maybe you're young, but that doesn't mean you can't make big contributions )","slug":"007 - 小英雄大贡献","date":"2017-04-03T03:39:40.000Z","updated":"2017-04-12T03:35:26.546Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/04/03/007 - 小英雄大贡献/","link":"","permalink":"http://abrandnewu.com.my/2017/04/03/007 - 小英雄大贡献/","excerpt":"","text":"Ezra Adrian Robert, Allegra Chan Qin Hur, Joseph Chung and Ivan Avannus are all teenagers aged between 14 to 16 from Sabah and Sarawak that had come up with an idea to end hunger and save Mother Nature at the same time.四名来自沙巴及砂拉越年龄介于14至16岁的青少年，分别是艾斯拉·阿德里安，田沁禾，锺明忠及伊万·阿万诺斯，他们以“解决全球贫穷课题”为基础，推出了一款剩余食物手机应用程序“Robin Food”。 Four of these youngsters presented their winning idea during the first ever Sime Darby Young Innovators Challenge (SDYIC) workshop in June 2016.

Back then Ian and his partners used their saving to rent a RM400 flat unit as their office. One of the main reason Ian and his partners stated a beauty business was because beauty is a untapped market, and there are strong online cosmetic brands leveraging on digital and social media, which makes Hermo a perfect platform to reach out to the consumers.Hermo成立于2012年2月，当时Ian Chua与他的伙伴花了四百令吉租了一间租屋单位作为他们的办公室。他们选择美容产品作为他们的首选是因为发现自己的女性朋友和家人在挑选化妆品质量的时候，花费了大量的时间，而通过研究，他发现美容产品能够实现强劲的利润率，并且相比其它垂直市场，通常能争取更高水平的客户忠诚度。所以选择将化妆品和护肤品作为创业内容，希望为其东南亚的客户带来购买化妆品的乐趣。 Chong, one of the founders of Hermo, was Ian’s classmate during his secondary school and he’s now their product manager. Both of them are 25 years old and this is their first venture without any prior experience. 1 year after Hermo was setip, Mok (Chief operating officer) joined them with his 10 years of experience in business management.

They are also planning to move Hermo R&amp;D and sourcing parts to Singapore in the near future.

She used the mixture of lemongrass and coconut milk to recreate a similar “Nasi Lemak” flavoured ice cream and then places the ingredients as toppings to the ice cream.花生，黄瓜，江鱼仔，三巴和水煮蛋都是椰浆饭必备的配料，你有想过将它们与冰淇淋结合会是一种怎样的概念吗？陈嘉慧用香茅混合椰浆创造出一款类似椰浆饭口味的冰淇淋，再将以上的配料摆在冰淇淋旁，别有一番风味。 Jia Hui mention that the purpose of creating this delicious delicacy is just to share her unique take of “Nasi Lemak” to everyone , but not to attract too much attention from the public. This Malaysian-style ice cream has been sold at the DIEM Cafe in Alor Setar. She named her original brand “Skream Softserve”.陈嘉慧说，她不想要受到瞩目也不是要搞噱头，她只想做出一些好吃的东西让大家喜欢，她也希望大家可以认同她自创的椰浆饭冰淇淋。这款极具马来西亚风味的冰淇淋已在亚罗士打的DIEM咖啡馆开始销售。陈嘉慧将她的独创食品命名为“Skream Softserve”。 #ABrandNewU每个人都有实现梦想的机会，你也有类似的经验？私聊A_Brand_New_U面子书，并且关注：Facebook- A_Brand_New_UInstagram- abrandnewu_youthknighted","categories":[{"name":"正能量故事","slug":"正能量故事","permalink":"http://abrandnewu.com.my/categories/正能量故事/"}],"tags":[{"name":"正能量故事","slug":"正能量故事","permalink":"http://abrandnewu.com.my/tags/正能量故事/"}]},{"title":"凡事都要一步一步来，有时候急于表现反而得不到想要的结果 ( Take things one step at a time.
